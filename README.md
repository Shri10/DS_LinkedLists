# LinkedList Implementations in C#

This repository demonstrates various operations performed on a LinkedList data structure using a Custom LinkedList in C#. Each of the operations corresponds to a unique branch as described below:

## Branches

- **UC1_CreateSimpleLinkedList**
    - A simple LinkedList is created.

- **UC2_Add-Nodes-In-Reverse**
    - Demonstrates how to add nodes to a LinkedList in reverse order.

- **UC3_Append-Nodes-In-Sequence**
    - Appends nodes to a LinkedList in the given sequence. 

- **UC4_Insert-Node-In-Middle**
    - Inserts a new node in the middle of the LinkedList.

- **UC5_Pop-First-Node**
    - Removes the first node of the LinkedList.

- **UC6_Pop-Last-Node**
    - Removes the last node from the LinkedList.

- **UC7_Search-Node-In-List**
    - Searches for a node in the LinkedList by its value.

- **UC8_Insert-Node-After-Specific-Node**
    - Inserts a new node after a specific node in the LinkedList.

- **UC9_Delete-Specific-Node-And-Show-Size**
    - Deletes a specific node from the LinkedList and shows the updated size of the LinkedList.

- **UC10_Create-Ordered-Linked-List**
    - Creates an ordered (sorted) LinkedList.
